histree is a Google Chrome Extension that I have been working on as a side
project for the past couple months. It is designed as a replacement for the menu
that pops up when you long press the back button. The main idea behind it is
that the conventional back button menu only displays the most recent branch of
the tree of pages that you have visited during your browsing session, whereas
histree will display all the branches.

To get a better idea of what I’m talking about, lets look at an example. Lets
suppose you are looking for a new bike on craigslist, so you bring up the
bicycles page of craigslist and start looking through the listings. At this
point your back button menu will look like:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo1.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

Which is about the same as your histree (except for the page thumbnails that
histree displays):

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo2.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

Now let’s suppose you start clicking through the results, looking at different
bike listings. After going through five of the listings, you may want to go back
and revisit one of them. Unfortunetly, your back button menu isn't going to be of
any help:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo3.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

But meanwhile, your histree has been working hard, keeping track of all the
different branches that have started to grow off of your original histree:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo4.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

So now if you want to go back to any of those listing you visited in the past,
they are right there in your histree! Histree even supports nested branches, so
if for example you were to start searching for an iPhone on craigslist, you
would still have your old bike search branch stored as a nested branch under
your iPhone branch:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo5.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

You’ll notice that as your histree gets more complex, it starts to get a little
harder to decipher its different branches. Luckily, you can always just follow
the green line that shows up when you highlight a link to find what branch a
given page is a part of.

Currently, histree is in the alpha stages of development and is not yet
available on the Chrome Web Store. As far as I’ve had time to test it,
everything looks to be working but it is not yet as smooth and polished as I
would like. I really have high hopes for histree, and I have been working hard
to get all the kinks ironed out so that it is something that people will find
useful and truly enjoy using. If you would like to help me test it and provide
feedback, or just try it out, you are welcome to download it
[here](/assets/histree.crx).

Note: Since it histree not in the Chrome Webstore yet, in order to install it,
you will need to download the [histree.crx](/assets/histree.crx) file, and then
drag and drop it into your Chrome Extensions page at
[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions).

Update 6/20/2014: The development effort continues! Things are starting to come
together, but its still not as polished as I would like it to be. Rather than
having seperate histree's for each tab, I've know unified them all into one
histree that is accessible from any tab. Beware of bugs and slow performance
when the histree grows too large. Feel free to check out the code on
[github](https://github.com/chipjacks/histree) or download this [.zip
file](/assets/histree_v2.zip) that contains a working version which can be
installed in Chrome by visiting the Chrome extensions page, enabling developer
mode, and then loading the unpacked zip file.
