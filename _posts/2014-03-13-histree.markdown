histree is a Google Chrome Extension that I have been working on as a side
project for the past couple months. It is designed as a replacement for the menu
that pops up when you long press the back button. The main idea behind it is
that the conventional back button menu only displays the most recent branch of
the tree of pages that you have visited during your browsing session, whereas
histree will display all the branches.

To get a better idea of what I’m talking about, lets look at an example. Lets
suppose you are looking for a new bike on craigslist, so you bring up the
bicycles page of craigslist and start looking through the listings. At this
point your back button menu will look like:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo1.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

Which is about the same as your histree (except for the page thumbnails that
histree displays):

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo2.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

Now let’s suppose you start clicking through the results, looking at different
bike listings. After going through five of the listings, you may want to go back
and revisit one of them. Unfortunetly, your back button menu isn't going to be of
any help:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo3.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

But meanwhile, your histree has been working hard, keeping track of all the
different branches that have started to grow off of your original histree:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo4.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

So now if you want to go back to any of those listing you visited in the past,
they are right there in your histree! Histree even supports nested branches, so
if for example you were to start searching for an iPhone on craigslist, you
would still have your old bike search branch stored as a nested branch under
your iPhone branch:

<div id="figure" align="center">
  <img src="/images/histreedemo5.png" width="95%" class="border">
</div>

You’ll notice that as your histree gets more complex, it starts to get a little
harder to decipher its different branches. Luckily, you can always just follow
the green line that shows up when you highlight a link to find what branch a
given page is a part of.
