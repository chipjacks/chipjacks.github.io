I have this crazy obsession with training logs for runners. It all started
back in college when I was competing for my school cross country and track
teams. Most runners on the team would just track weekly mileage and that was
about the only metric they really cared about. Then, if we wanted to share
our training, we’d all just send around a spreadsheet to list our weekly
mileage on. “Oh wow, Dylan ran 110 miles last week, he must be fit!” It was a
conveniently simple way to look at fitness that often fell apart on race day
when the guys who had been putting in the most mileage would show up injured
or just slow and tired.

There must be a better way! My first attempt was
[RhinoLog](http://rhino-log.herokuapp.com/). It tracked both your mileage and
how you were feeling. So it tried to emphasize the importance of listening to
your body, not just mindlessly slogging through workouts. It even let you
send a text message to record a run so you didn’t have to pull out your
computer just to record that you ran 5 miles. It all felt pretty innovative at the
time.

Fast-forward 5 years and things have evolved considerably. Most
runners wear GPS watches and then upload their training to services like
Garmin, Strava, RunKeeper, etc. This relieves some of the annoyance of having
to manually record your training and provides you with a lot more details.
But all that data is still really hard to make sense of, especially when
aggregated over long periods of time. I often find myself falling back to my
old ways of just tracking weekly mileage and not worrying too much about
anything else. It seems like such a shame to be recording all this data,
without being able to produce many meaningful or actionable insights from
it. At the very least I’d like to be able to easily identify patterns and
trends in my training, beyond just the changes in weekly mileage.

So that’s where [Training Blocks](http://www.trainingblocks.co/) comes in. Its
goal is to be a better way to visualize and understand your training. Forget
scrolling through tables filled with numbers and logs filled with text. That
makes it next to impossible to make much sense of your training on a larger
scale. Instead, it uses a few simple visual elements that can be combined to
really capture the trends and nuances in your training. A block represents
both the duration and the pace of a run. By combining blocks you can put
together complex workouts, and then zoom out to see how they fit into the
broader scheme of things. An emoji represents how you’re feeling and is much
easier to visually parse than a string of text. Additional icons can be used
to indicate things like hill workouts, which skew the pace of your run, or
cross training, which has no pace at all, only duration.

Going forward, I have many more ideas on how the platform can grow to
incorporate more aspects. For example, one of the most important
things to keep track of in training is what your goals are and how you're
stacking up against them. If you’re goals are too extreme, you’ll fall apart
trying to chase them. Or if they’re too modest or non-existent, you can
become disengaged and fail to meet your full potential. Training Blocks
could use colored blocks to help you calibrate. By setting goals using orange
blocks, and comparing them to actual performances in blue, you can maximize
the overlapping green. This allows you a lot more flexibility than just
setting weekly mileage goals, while maintaining the simple visualization
tools that make sense when viewing your training from a wider perspective.

And then there’s the social aspect of training. It’s a lot more enjoyable to
be able to share your journey with other people, even when things aren’t
going great. Gathering “likes” is fun but can be disheartening if you start
to notice how many more someone else is getting. The same can be said
about comparing your fitness levels with someone else’s. So that’s why
Training Blocks will seek to hide the metrics that are commonly used for
making comparisons when you share parts of your training with a wider
audience. The focus will be on the overall shape of your training and where
you’re trying to go with it. Things like what sorts of workouts and races
you're planning and how you're measuring up against your goals. The idea is to
put more emphasis on the intrinsic aspects of training that provide
sustainable joy and motivation over the long term. Training Blocks is
intended to be a supportive platform that encourages you to save your
competitive instincts for race day.

So those are some of the ideas bouncing around in my head. I’d be curious to
hear from other runners to see how I can adapt [Training
Blocks](http://www.trainingblocks.co/) to better serve them. While it
was initially motivated by my own needs and ideas, the real goal is
for it to evolve to be something that serves a wider audience of runners. So if
you have a moment to fill out [this
survey](https://goo.gl/forms/nPLB2NZNfGoUXZvS2), that would be really
helpful. Or just give it a shot for yourself and let me know what you think!
It's still in the early stages of development so any input now can really
help shape how things turn out.
