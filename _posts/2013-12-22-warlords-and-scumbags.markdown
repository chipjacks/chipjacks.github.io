categories: projects
---

This was a quarter long project for a networking course I took. We were required
to build a client and server to handle playing the Warlords and Scumbags card
game (aka Presidents and Assholes) over a network. We developed the protocol for
communication between clients and servers as a class, and then did the rest
of the project individually.

The main focus of the project was on the client and server implementation, but
I also built a simple text-based user interface:

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/warlords_scumbags_gui.png" width="90%"/>
</div>

From this project, I gained experience with:

* Python
* Client-server model
* Git
* Sockets
* Threading
* Unit testing
* Protocol development
* Text-based UI's
