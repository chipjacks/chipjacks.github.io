In a networking course I took this past quarter, the class was assigned a
quarter long project where we were required to build a client and server to
handle playing the Warlords and Scumbags card game (aka 
[Presidents and Assholes](http://www.pagat.com/climbing/asshole.html))
over a network. We developed the protocol for communication between clients and
servers as a class, and then did the rest of the project individually.

The main focus of the project was on the client and server implementation, but
I also built a simple text-based user interface:

<div align="center">

</div>

From this project, I gained experience with:

* Python
* Client-server model
* Git
* Sockets
* Threading
* Unit testing
* Protocol development
* Text-based UI's using the Python
[curses](http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/curses.html) module
