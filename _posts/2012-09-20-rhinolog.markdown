[Rhinolog.net](http://www.rhinolog.net/) was the result of an independent summer
project. The overall design goal was to build something that was quick, simple,
and easy to use. It also featured the ability to be able to log runs by sending
an SMS text message, for those users who may not have a smartphone yet.

As my first independent coding project, it was a big learning experience for me.
I remember it being pretty overwhelming just trying to figure out what all the
different technologies used to build a webapp were, such as: HTML, CSS,
AJAX, Javascript, jQuery, Coffeescript, PostgreSQL, JSON, XML, Twilio, Ruby, 
Rails… I hadn’t even heard of most of those before I started the project, so I
was proud of myself for sticking with it and finishing it.
