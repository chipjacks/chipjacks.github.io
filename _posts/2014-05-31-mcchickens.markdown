I’m going to be graduating from college in a couple weeks and for the past year
or so I’ve been scrambling around like a maniac trying to get my all my ducks in
a row. So yeah, this is one of those posts. I’m sure you’ve read one of
[these](http://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/)
before. The anxious college graduate, emerging from their small little
bubble with frantic wide eyes, desperately trying to make sense of the
real-world, desperately trying to take everything they are going through and
boil it down into one main thesis, just as they’ve learned to do in their
English classes. 

Problem is, I didn’t really take any English classes in college cuz wereds our
harrd. So if I could never even make any sense of <i>Animal
Farm</i>, how the hell am I going to make sense of the world? Well lucky for you,
I’ve been doing some thinking, crunching the numbers, and I think I’ve got it
all figured out.

Being a math and computer science major, it’s only natural for me to try and
phrase every problem I face as some sort of optimization problem. Here, we are
simply seeking to discover the key to happiness. If we build a model for an
individuals happiness, <i>h</i>, based on parameters such as comfort, love, resources,
health, income, shoe size, and 217 other standard metrics that have been shown
to correlate (see Appendix A for a full list), we get a convex 223-dimensional
objective function which can be optimized in O(n^3) time using a Quasi-Newton
cubic line search algorithm and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon (BFGS)
formula for updating the approximation of the Hessian matrix.

…

Gotchya! I bet I had you going there for a minute. I really hope you didn’t go
to the trouble of scrolling all the way down to the bottom of the article in
search of Appendix A. Honestly though, I suspect if it were me reading this
article I probably would have taken the bait just because I’m a sucker for that
kind of thing. I’m always looking for some little key to success or happiness so
I’m a total sucker for any self-help book or scientific study that claims to
have any sort of answers for me. A couple weeks ago it was drinking more
[coffee](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201205/coffee-happiness)
. Last week it was 
[talking to strangers](http://nyti.ms/1lMMCwY) 
more. This week it was getting a new haircut. A few years ago, it was 
[eating more yogurt](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/real-males-eat-yogurt/)
to get more swag and bigger testicles. I’m always looking
for that little tip that will somehow help me squeeze just a little bit more out
of life.

Not that there is anything wrong with that - I think it’s just part of human
nature to always be looking to improve our situation. Fortunately, great
American innovators like Ronald McDonald have freed us from having to worry
about 
[lower-level issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) 
like starvation, so instead we get to focus most of
our time on the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, great American innovators
like Ronald McDonald have created all kinds of false paths to happiness to
distract us from the real ones.

The difficulty with pursuing happiness is that there are so many different ways
to go about it, and since each individual is different, there is no
one-size-fits-all solution. There are certainly some more tried-and-true
methods, such as surrounding yourself with loving family and friends, finding a
rewarding career, or eating 10 McChickens in an hour, but even those likely
produce varying results for different individuals.

To complicate things further, an individual’s happiness optimizer can get broken
in a variety of ways. It may stop being able to find things that produce
happiness (depression) and it may even just give up completely on ever being
happy again leading to suicide. Or it may over-optimize for short-term happiness
(drug/McChicken addiction) or for long-term happiness (workaholic?). There is
also the tendency for your happiness optimizer to play tricks on you, leading
you to rationalize poor decisions in the moment that will only end up hurting
you in the long run.

As I’m writing this, one of my roommates just came up and walked me through a
complicated decision he is currently facing in an effort to optimize his
happiness:

<blockquote>
<p>
“I think I’m going to go get the five buck lunch at DQ.”
<p>
“Oh okay cool!”
<p>
[awkward silence, while he waits to see if I have any input on his decision]
<p>
“But is it worth it?” I ask.
<p>
“Hmmm, that depends on what you mean by worth it. It is a pretty good deal!”
<p>
I explain to him that I am writing an article about optimizing happiness, and
then we proceed to discuss whether the 5 buck lunch is the best way to optimize
his happiness.
<p>
“Well I’m pretty hungry and it sounds pretty good right now.”
<p>
“Alright, well I would argue that fast food is more geared towards optimizing
short-term happiness.”
<p>
“Oh yeah, because if you want to be in shape and healthy in the future, eating fast food is bad.”
<p>
“Yep, and also eating more nutritious food will likely provide you with more sustained
energy for later in the day.”
<p>
“Hmmmm, well I could go get groceries, but I’m pretty broke right now, so I can’t afford a big grocery trip and I’m kind of
forced to live meal to meal.”
<p>
“Shoot, well that complicates things.”
<p>
“And plus, if I go get groceries now, since I’m really hungry I’d probably not make the
best decisions about what I buy.”
<p>
“That’s also true, I know how that goes!”
<p>
“Alright, I’m going to DQ.”
</blockquote>

So we can see that just deciding what to eat for lunch can become an incredibly
complicated decision if you really dig into the whole optimizing for happiness
aspect of it. 

What’s more, even if you do manage to find a reliable strategy for optimizing
your personal happiness, it probably won’t work forever because over time your
mind will build up a certain tolerance for it. Your 10th McChicken probably
isn’t going to taste nearly as good as your first, so at some point you’re
probably going to have to start looking for other sources of happiness besides
eating more McChickens. 

So far, I probably haven’t said anything you didn’t already know. Maybe you
don’t consciously think about optimizing happiness on a regular basis, but on
some level you probably already realized you’re going through the process. So in
an effort to tie all of this together and give you some sort of meaningful
takeaway, I’m going to give you this: <i>there is no key to happiness.</i>

Sorry, that was the best I could come up with. If you are anything like me, you
were probably hoping for something more uplifting or meaningful, or a new way to
look at life that makes you happier overnight. Maybe something like “those who
smile on the outside smile on the inside as well,” or “the more happiness you
give the more you get,” or maybe “even the poor can be rich with happiness;
McChickens are only a dollar.”

Alright, I made those up, but if I didn’t tell you that I bet I could have
convinced you they came straight from Ghandi’s mouth and you would have made one
of them your new mantra. And who knows, maybe there is some truth to them, but
really they should all probably have an asterisk by them with “results may
vary,” because it turns out happiness is rarely simple enough to be summed up in
one sentence.

It’s so easy to get caught up looking for one simple key to happiness and to
invest too heavily in one simple idea or mindset, especially for a young and
naive person like myself. I think the hardest thing for me to accept is that I’m
always going to have struggles and failures, and that no matter how hard I work
or how good I get at optimizing my own happiness, things are always going to go
wrong and I’m always going to have to stop and reevaluate things when they blow
up in my face.

The really ironic thing is that as I write this, I feel like I've finally got it
all figured out. Like I'll never want to give up again. Like I'm ready for any
punch that comes my way. But I know I'm not. I’m frickin’ 23 and I still cry
when I have a bad race. Most days I feel like I've killed it if I
manage to make it to bed without feeling hopelessly overwhelmed and depressed by
all the troubles of the day, and the hardest thing I have to do most days is sit
on my computer and tell it what to do. It's a miracle to me that there are so
many adults who have survived to be 50 and are still happy even after all the
loss they’ve been through. Deaths, divorces, injuries, addictions, diseases,
wars, job losses, hair loss, I don't know how anyone comes back from any of
those. 

I used to dream of living to be 100. Someone once told me that the President
will send you a letter when you turn 100 to congratulate you. And I was gonna
get that damn letter or I was gonna die trying. Well it turns out living to 100
isn’t such a cakewalk. 
[This piece](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/17/140217fa_fact_angell?currentPage=all)
does a great job illuminating some of the struggles one man has run into on his
way to 93. I honestly don’t know how he made it after reading about everything
he’s been through, but it turns out neither does he. About losing his wife, he
writes:

<blockquote>
<p>
Another message—also brief, also breathtaking—came on an earlier afternoon at my longtime therapist’s, at a
time when I felt I’d lost almost everything. “I don’t know how I’m going to get
through this,” I said at last.
<p>
A silence, then: “Neither do I. But you will.”
</blockquote>

Somehow that makes me feel better, knowing that even the old and wise don’t have
it all figured out.

In many ways I’ve been looking at my graduation date as a deadline. A deadline
to find what makes me happy, as if there is some finish line to the pursuit of
happiness. Like if I could just find that right career, find that right partner,
achieve that one goal then I would just be happy forever and all the problems of
the world would just fade away and I would stop losing my hair. Well I ran
pretty hard and pretty far in college, but somehow that finish line never really
seemed to get any closer. But I’m okay with that now, because I still had a
blast chasing it and I think that’s the real takeaway from it all.

Even when I turn 100, I’ll probably still be chasing that finish line, just
scramblin’ my way through life. But at least then I’ll get a letter from the
President congratulating me for not giving up, and I bet that will make me real
happy for a couple days until I lose it in a massive pile of crossword puzzles.
And then I’ll have to find something else to make me happy, and life will go on.
