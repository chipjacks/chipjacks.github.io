Google was introduced in 1998 in a 
[paper](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html)
published by Stanford graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin. In this
paper they outlined the details behind their PageRank algorithm for calculating
the importance of webpages on the internet. In its simplest form, the
algorithm gives a page an importance score based off of the number of other
pages that link to it. Google uses this importance score to sort the pages in
their search result list, which helps eliminate junk results and bring relevant
results to the top of the list.

To get into the details of the algorithm a small amount of graph theory is
involved, and a larger amount of linear algebra. I gave a presentation on these
details for a graph theory class I was in recently. Check out the 
[slides here](/images/pagerank_slides.pdf)!

The PageRank algorithm is a great example of how math can be
applied to solve important problems in computer science. The linear algebra and
graph theory fit beautifully into solving the PageRank problem, demonstrating
how well these two abstract fields can be used to model the real world.

During the project I also spent some time playing with web crawlers and did some
crawling of the [WWU website](http://www.wwu.edu/) using the 
[Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) Python module. The initial goal was to perform
PageRank on all the pages within the wwu.edu domain, but it turned out to be more
difficult then I anticipated translating the complex hyperlink structure into a
simple and complete web that would work well for PageRank. From my 
[experience](/posts/2013/09/24/IMDB-Stats.html) it seems gathering,
cleansing, and making sense of data is rarely as quick and easy as it
sounds.
