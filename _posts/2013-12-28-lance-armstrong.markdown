I still believe in Lance Armstrong.

This article isn’t really even about Lance Armstrong though; it’s more about
second chances, about believing in people even when they make terrible mistakes.
Because we’ve all made mistakes, and lots of them. Maybe you haven’t been
cheating and making millions of dollars off of it, but if you think that makes
you a better person then Lance Armstrong this article is going to challenge you
to reconsider.

What kind of mistakes have you made in your life? Personally, most of the
mistakes I’ve made in the past seem pretty inevitable. Like the time at recess
in 2nd grade when I beat up a kid because my friend told me to. Seems ridiculous
now, but at the time I’d been watching some violent movies and hanging around
some violent friends and it seemed like the right thing to do. My environment
had twisted my morals.

The mistakes Lance Armstrong has made are a long shot from beating someone up in
2nd grade. As a grown man, he has a responsibility to build and maintain strong
moral principles, and he should be held accountable for his actions. But the
circumstances he was under are also a lot more severe then the circumstances I
was under in 2nd grade. Imagine going to recess and having everyone just beating
each other up. Yeah sure it’s against the rules, but the recess duty isn’t
paying attention or doing anything about it. Plus, the people who beat the most
people up are getting rewarded with popularity and even some cash prizes! Maybe
you’ve been raised in a strict anti-violence household and you’ll manage to
abstain, but the kids who love to roughhouse are going to have a lot of trouble
convincing themselves to stay out of it.

Just try and put yourself in Lance Armstrong’s shoes for a minute. You’re an
extremely driven young man, determined to prove yourself. You’re also insanely
competitive, you would probably be willing to saw your kneecap off with a rusty
butter knife if you thought that would help your chances of winning. So you’re
working your ass off to be successful as a professional cyclist, but one day you
find yourself in an environment where all the successful people are doping. What
are you going to do? This is precisely the situation Levi Leipheimer found 
himself in, which he stated when he publicly confessed to doping:

<blockquote>
<p>
Until recently—or maybe even until today—when people thought about doping, they
thought about a guy, by himself, using banned substances to get ahead. What
people didn't realize—what I didn't realize until after I was already committed
to this career—was that doping was organized and everywhere in the peloton.
Doping wasn't the exception, it was the norm.
</p>
<p>
When I was a 13-year-old kid, my dream was to ride the Tour de France. I fully
devoted my life to that goal. I left home as a teenager, passed on a college
degree, moved to Europe at 19 and lived in hostels with roommates who didn't
speak my language. 
</p>
<p>
Having made sacrifices for my dream, several years after I turned pro, I came
to see cycling for what it was: a sport where some team managers and doctors
coordinated and facilitated the use of banned substances and methods by their
riders. A sport where the athletes at the highest level—perhaps without
exception—used banned substances. A sport where doping was so accepted that
riders from different teams—who were competitors on the road—coordinated their
doping to keep up with other riders doing the same thing.
</p>
<p>
I regret that this was the state of affairs in the sport that we love and I
chose as my career. I am sorry that I was forced to make the decisions I made. I
admit that I didn’t let doping deter me from my dream. I admit that I used
banned substances. I know that learning this will disappoint many of my fans
and friends and I am sorry that the sport and I have let you down.
</p>
<p>
Right or wrong, in my mind the choice was “do it or go home.” For me that was
not a choice.
</p>
<p>
People will be disappointed and say I was wrong, that I should have chosen
differently, and am just making excuses. I made the decision I made. I don’t
offer this description of the sport as an excuse, simply as an explanation of
the context and reason for my decision. I won’t lie about it—I have to own it—I
accept responsibility for my decision.
</p>
<p>
I could have come forward sooner. But would that have accomplished
anything—other than to end my career? One rider coming forward and telling his
story in the face of cycling’s code of silence would not have fixed a problem
that was institutional.

Alright, enough about 2nd grade recess and professional cycling. The point I’m
trying to make here is that the people that make the worst mistakes are often
the people who are in the worst situations. These people are often the victims
just as much as they are the perpetrators. But these people are so easy to
blame, and that’s exactly what the world does.

Think about how the media portrays criminals. The headlines and the focus is on
the things they’ve done wrong, not on what may have brought them to commit the
crime. I’m not blaming the media for this—it would be pretty unrealistic to
expect anything else—but overtime I think this approach desensitizes people. You
hear about people shooting each other in Compton enough times and eventually
you’re probably going to start thinking Compton must just be full of bad people.
You start to think about how different the people in Compton must be from you,
and how you are such a good person for not shooting anyone on your way to work
this morning. You stop caring about Compton, maybe you even wish all those
people would just disappear and stop causing so many problems for the world.

So what’s the solution? I think that as individuals, we can do a better job of
understanding other people’s mistakes. The next time someone you know makes
a mistake, don’t hate them for it! Show some compassion and try and figure out
what has led them to make the mistake. Focus on the source of the mistake, not
the outcome it’s caused.

It’s so easy to hate Lance Armstrong right now. Like a lot of people, he was my
hero. My (used to be) favorite Lance Armstrong quote is:

<blockquote>
<p>
“Everyone wants to know what I’m on. What am I on? I’m on my bike, busting my
ass 6 hours a day. What are you on?”

It took me a long time to believe he had been lying and come to terms with the
fact that he had cheated. Honestly, I’m still trying to come to terms with it
and maybe I never will. But that doesn’t matter, what matters is that I’m not
going to just give up on him. I’m going to keep working to understand him with
the hope of someday being able to forgive him.
