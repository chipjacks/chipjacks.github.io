I recently attended a workshop where we were pointed at
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/), shown a few examples, and then just given time to
play with it. The simple API for drawing shapes immediately reminded me of [Elm
Collage](https://github.com/timjs/elm-collage) which I had used years ago to
make a little game titled [Hungry
Snowman](https://chipjacks.com/hungry-snowman/). With only 45 minutes left in
the workshop, I quickly decided to try and remake Doodle Jump, one of my
favorite old iPhone games. By the end of the workshop I had a circle bouncing
up and down on my screen with rectangles falling past it and I was HOOKED.

The process of making a small Javascript game was a perfect project to pair
with ChatGPT and some fun sketches created by my friend. Leveraging AI made it
possible to generate much of the boring code and quickly get past any hiccups
due to my inexperience with the p5.js library, freeing me to focus on the
creative and fun decisions. I was even able to generate a custom typeface for
the title page using [GenType](https://labs.google/gentype) and a little
soundtrack for the game using [Strofe](https://www.strofe.com/library).

Hope you have as much playing it as I had making it ðŸ¤˜
