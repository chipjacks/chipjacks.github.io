The 
[COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/)
is an international undergraduate
math competition held every year in February.  It is held over a four-day
weekend, during which students are required to use mathematical modeling to
solve real world problems and submit a report detailing their findings. I
participated in the competition in 2012 with a team of two other WWU students.
The [problem](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2012/problems/)
we worked on involved scheduling recreational river rafting trips
down a hypothetical river that had a limited number of uniformly distributed
campsites. We managed to devise an algorithm to simulate the movement of rafting
trips between campsites, and used that simulation to solve the problem presented
to us.

It was a brutal and sleepless weekend trying to get the report completed in time
for the 5pm Monday deadline. But our efforts paid off when we received the
results and found out that from among the 3697 submissions, our paper had been
chosen as winner and was going to be published in 
[The UMAP Journal](http://216.250.163.249//product/?idx=1365). 
A copy of our paper can be found [here](/images/UMAP_river.pdf).
