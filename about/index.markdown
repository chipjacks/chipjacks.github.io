Hi, I'm Chip. 

I'm a recent graduate of Western Washington University, where I majored in
mathematics and computer science.

This blog is intended to be a place for me to publish my work and
share things I learn.

The intimate personal details: I like to eat pizza, my favorite color is blue,
and I've been to Hawaii before. Also, I like to run.

Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or feedback!
