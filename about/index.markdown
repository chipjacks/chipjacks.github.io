My name is Chip Jackson. I am currently a student at Western Washington
Univeristy majoring in math and computer science with a minor in
physics. This blog is intended to be a place for me to publish my work and
share things I learn. I will be looking for work in software engineering
following my graduation in Spring 2014. Feel free to contact me with any
questions, comments, feedback, or job opportunites!

Beyond math and computer science, I love to run. I
[compete](http://www.wwuvikings.com/sports/c-xc/mtt/jackson_chip00.html)
for the WWU track and cross country teams.
