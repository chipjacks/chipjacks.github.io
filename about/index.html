  My name is Chip Jackson. I am currently a student at Western Washington
  Univeristy majoring in math and computer science with a minor in
  physics. This blog is intended to be a place for me to publish my work and
  share things I learn. I will be looking for work in software engineering
  following my graduation in Spring 2014. Feel free to contact me with any
  questions, comments, feedback, recruiting, etc.
